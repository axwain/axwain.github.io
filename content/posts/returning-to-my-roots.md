+++

I learned programming through making small games, using a piece of software called _Game Maker_. It was in the era when it wasn't that well known, and it was still being developed by Mark Overmars. I wasn't in a place where people knew english, let alone how to code, so I was on my own to overcome the language barrier and learn programming (at the time, I didn't even knew I was learning to write software). We had an old HP printer with failing ink cartridges. I used that to print Game Maker's manual, and it came with pinkish colors. That was the start of everything.

Last year's thanks giving, _Game Maker_ [announced a more generous free tier](https://gamemaker.io/en/blog/gamemaker-free-platforms), and my brother told me about it. I thought perhaps I can use it again, to return to my roots as a programmer. I downloaded and installed it. I fire it up and... Things felt way too different.

I didn't want to write games in an engine with a restrictive license, nor where I felt way too constrained to do things, so I end up uninstalling Game Maker and not doing anything, but it got me thinking.

## Searching alternatives

I have been working on web front-ends for a good while now. Returning to _Game Maker_ felt like trying to relearn a bunch of things in one-go, and it felt too restrictive. In one of my previous jobs I used a lot of [PixiJs](https://pixijs.com/) to write mini-games for playable ads. Nothing fancy, and I have learned a lot since then.

I tried using PixiJs again but, at the time it was the right tool for the job due to all the constraints I had. What if, I can use something different and has more features for games than PixiJs? After all, I have more freedom of choice now.

I searched a little and found [KaboomJs](https://kaboomjs.com/). It is a relatively small library, it has a ton of basic constructs for games, and the best of all, The documentation is in a long web page that I could totally print or at least save as a PDF for offline reading.

This feels like returning to my roots, it has a little of the magic I experienced when using Game Maker 4 and 5. I think it will be good to use for making some short games and publish them to [itch.io](https://itch.io/).

There are other more well known web game engines, like Cocos, BabylonJs, Phaser, but those are more complex (i.e., a bigger learning curve) and I can't just download a single PDF with all the documentation. Another alternative could have been [Raylib](https://www.raylib.com/), it also has a [small cheatsheet](https://www.raylib.com/cheatsheet/cheatsheet.html) with everything one may need to create small games. The reason I didn't pick that up is because it would add learning a new language to use, and the idea is to not overwhelm myself with too many new things at the same time. It is better to go slow and steady.

Nevertheless, I'll switch to Raylib eventually (or to any framework or engine that can be ported to consoles with relatively ease)

## So, what's next then?

I'll leverage my web front-end experience to learn to use _KaboomJs_ and make some small games. I'm thinking of doing a sort of multigame cart web compilation of those mini games. I grow up playing a famiclone (child me was unaware of that!) and the multigame carts were the norm back then. So, for nostalgia sake, I'll do that.

I also have in mind doing another game project, one that uses the fusion mechanic from Yu-Gi-Oh! Forbidden Memories, but that would be a more involving project. I'll do that one when I'm not that rusty making games.

For assets, I think I'll use [Kenney's ones](https://kenney.nl/assets). It would be similar to what I did when I started with Game Maker. Back then, I used Ari Fieldman's spritelib (no longer available unfortunately).

## Final Thoughts

Wish me luck with this side project of returning to my roots (kinda). Life matters got on my way and I strayed further and further of what I wanted to do and learn.

Due to some personal circumstances, I have to still work on web front-ends, but I hope I can move to something more challenging soon. In the meantime, these side projects should fill my cup for challenging task.

Best regards dear reader, and have a good day.
