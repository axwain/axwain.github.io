Hi! I'm [AXwain](https://github.com/axwain) a software engineer that has been programming for 10+ years in a professional manner. Before that I was just another hobbyist writing small games and learning game development. You can call me Ax.

Due to life circumstances I have ended up with more job opportunities working on User Interfaces, and mostly web front-ends. Unfortunately, that line of work becomes not so challenging after a while and not much can be learnt without more harder problems to solve.

To be able to keep my skills sharp, and let my curiosity and desire to learn new things be the driver, I started this web site where I'll document things I have been doing in side projects.

I wish I can start this with a lot of things already published, but unfortunately I don't have much to show in projects. That will change eventually of course! I'm itching to do a lot of things and to be able to share them if possible.

Thanks for visiting this humble corner of the internet and I hope the contents here can be useful, entertaining or educative in some way.

Best Regards dear reader.
